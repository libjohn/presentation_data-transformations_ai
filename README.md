An invited presentation on how the [CDVS](https://library.duke.edu/data) assists library patrons with data transformation and data analysis with, and without, AI-assisted coding. The presentation considers how AI changes the nature of consultation and data questions, where AI excels and misses, and makes recommendations for best practices when using AI.

Slides can be [viewed with a web browser (optimized](https://people.duke.edu/~jrl/ai/lab/)), or a [PDF](https://people.duke.edu/~jrl/ai/lab/index.pdf) (web version is recommended. PDF is offered as a secondary, lower fidelity option.)
